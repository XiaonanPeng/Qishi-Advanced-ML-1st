This repository is for the first advanced machine learning study group in Qishi. The following is our syllabus:

### Lecture 0: Introduction
This introduction contains the main content of this course, helping everyone to organize the models we are going to study, the connections between these models, and combining real-world applications to briefly explain the principles and importance of some parts of the models.
